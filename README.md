Simple rust project

A small Rust project for learning various Rust examples & experiments, focusing on core Rust concepts.

Overview

Simple rust project is a collection of small Rust exercises and example programs intended for learning Rust fundamentals.  
It’s not meant as a production library, but rather as a “playground” / sandbox for practicing Rust syntax, ownership, structs, vectors, modules, and basic data manipulation.

Key goals:
- Explore Rust syntax & semantics in small, isolated examples  
- Provide working Rust code you can compile and run easily  
- Help beginners understand Rust by reading and modifying simple projects
